# Runtime-Native Evals

Cayu evals are designed to test agent behavior through the Cayu runtime, not
only final model text.

The goal is two-part:

- provide stable abstractions so applications can bring their own eval stack
- provide a simple local/CI default for teams that want something built in

The built-in runner evaluates normal `CayuApp.run(...)` sessions and then
asserts over the durable runtime state Cayu already owns: sessions, events,
transcripts, tool calls, usage, workspaces, and artifacts.

## Minimal Example

```python
from cayu import (
    AgentSpec,
    CayuApp,
    EvalCase,
    EvalSuite,
    FinalOutputContains,
    Message,
    RunRequest,
    ScriptedModelProvider,
    SessionCompleted,
    run_eval_suite,
)
from cayu.providers import ModelStreamEvent


async def main():
    app = CayuApp(enable_logging=False)
    app.register_provider(
        ScriptedModelProvider(
            [
                ModelStreamEvent.text_delta("done"),
                ModelStreamEvent.completed({"finish_reason": "stop"}),
            ]
        ),
        default=True,
    )
    app.register_agent(AgentSpec(name="agent", model="fake-model"))

    suite = EvalSuite(
        id="basic",
        cases=[
            EvalCase(
                id="says-done",
                request=RunRequest(
                    agent_name="agent",
                    messages=[Message.text("user", "say done")],
                    max_steps=1,
                ),
                assertions=[
                    SessionCompleted(),
                    FinalOutputContains("done"),
                ],
            )
        ],
    )

    result = await run_eval_suite(app, suite)
    assert result.status == "passed"
```

## CLI

`cayu eval run` loads a Python target. The target should return one of:

- `EvalPlan(app=app, suite=suite)`
- `(app, suite)`
- an object or dict with `app` and `suite`

Example:

```bash
cayu eval run my_project.evals:build --output results.json
cayu eval report results.json --format html --output eval-report.html
cayu eval compare baseline.json results.json --output comparison.json
```

The command exits with `0` when all cases pass and `1` when the run fails,
errors, or a comparison detects regressions.

## Built-In Assertion Areas

Current assertions cover:

- session status
- final output text
- transcript text
- event occurrence and absence
- tool call counts
- tool arguments
- tool result text
- model step and token ceilings
- estimated-cost ceilings with a supplied pricing catalog
- workspace file existence/content
- artifact creation

## Workspace isolation

Cases in a suite run against the **same** `CayuApp`. Each case is a separate session, but it
shares the app's workspace unless you register the environment with an **environment factory**
(`register_environment_factory(...)`), which provisions a fresh environment — and a fresh
workspace — per session.

Because of this, `WorkspaceFileExists` / `WorkspaceFileContains` assert *"the file is present in
the workspace when the case finished"*, **not** *"this case created it"*. With a single shared
environment, a file written by an earlier case will satisfy a later case's workspace assertion.
To isolate per case, register an environment factory (or clean up the workspace yourself between
cases).

## Eval modes

The same suite/assertion surface supports several modes:

- **Deterministic** — drive the run with a `ScriptedModelProvider` (and fake tools). Hermetic,
  fast, and provider-free — ideal for CI. This is what the Minimal Example and most tests use.
- **Integration** — run against real providers, tools, runners, and environments to check whether
  the agent actually solves the task and to capture real cost/latency/tool usage. Slower and
  optionally gated behind credentials.
- **Replay / regression** — persist a run's `Trajectory`, then re-run the assertions against it
  later to catch regressions; compare a baseline to the current run with `compare_eval_runs` (or
  `cayu eval compare`). See [Trajectories & Replay](#trajectories--replay).
- **Offline** — evaluate a *captured* trajectory (`load_trajectory` → `evaluate_assertions`) with
  no live runtime, on any machine, from a saved JSON file.
- **Online** *(future)* — score production sessions and promote them into eval cases/datasets. The
  serializable `Trajectory` already makes a production run replayable; the promotion helper and
  datasets are planned follow-ups.

## LLM Judges

For *subjective* quality — "is this answer helpful / accurate / on-tone?" — a deterministic
check isn't enough. `LLMJudge` is a graded assertion: a model scores the run's output on a
continuous 0..1 scale against a rubric, and that score flows into the case/run score via the
score-first format (`score >= threshold` decides pass/fail).

```python
from cayu import AgentSpec, AnthropicProvider, CayuApp, EvalCase, LLMJudge

# A judging runtime — typically a stronger / different model than the agent under test.
judge_app = CayuApp()
judge_app.register_provider(AnthropicProvider(), default=True)
judge_app.register_agent(AgentSpec(name="judge", model="claude-opus-4-8"))

case = EvalCase(
    id="helpfulness",
    request=...,
    assertions=[
        LLMJudge(
            judge_app,
            agent_name="judge",
            rubric="Score how helpful and accurate the answer is.",
            threshold=0.7,
        ),
    ],
)
```

The judge runs **its own** agent (you configure the provider/model on `judge_app`), so judging is
an explicit, separate dependency rather than reaching into the run under test — and it is
deterministically testable by injecting a scripted provider. Every judgment is **auditable**:
`metadata` records the judge's provider/model, the `rubric` (and optional `rubric_version`), the
exact `prompt`, the raw `judge_output`, and the parsed `score`/`rationale`. Pass
`include_transcript=True` to give the judge the full transcript, not just the final output.

## Trajectories & Replay

A **`Trajectory`** is the serializable *record* of one run — its session, events,
transcript, usage, a captured probe snapshot (the workspace files and artifacts the
case's assertions need), and any sub-agent runs as nested children. It is also the
assertion substrate: assertions evaluate against a `Trajectory` (via the `EvalContext`
their `evaluate()` receives — `EvalContext` is the assertion's *view* of a trajectory plus
the case identity).

Because it is serializable, a run can be saved and re-checked later **without a live
runtime** — the replay loop:

```python
from cayu import (
    run_eval_case, write_trajectory_json, load_trajectory, evaluate_assertions,
)

# 1. Run, asking the runner to retain the probe-complete trajectory it built.
result = await run_eval_case(app, case, suite_id="suite", retain_trajectory=True)
assert result.trajectory is not None  # populated because retain_trajectory=True

# 2. Persist it (opt-in; a plain JSON file you manage — no automatic retention).
write_trajectory_json(result.trajectory, "run.json")

# 3. Later / elsewhere: reload and re-run the same assertions offline.
restored = load_trajectory("run.json")
results = await evaluate_assertions(restored, case.assertions)
assert all(r.passed for r in results)
```

`retain_trajectory` defaults to `False`, so a normal run keeps its existing memory profile
and the trajectory is dropped after the case. The trajectory is **excluded from the saved
`EvalRun` JSON** — the score-first baseline shape is unchanged; the trajectory is a separate,
opt-in export.

Replay is faithful for the assertions the run captured: event / transcript / usage / output /
tool assertions always re-check correctly, and a workspace or artifact assertion replays as long
as it was part of the original run (its probe was captured then). Replaying with a *new*
workspace/artifact assertion whose path or scope the original run did **not** probe reports
"not captured" rather than a real result.

Two v1 simplifications worth knowing: a workspace *existence* probe reads the whole file
(fine for the small, trusted workspaces evals run against), and a workspace "file not found"
result reports the path without the underlying OS error string.

## Interop

The default result format is JSON. It is intentionally simple so downstream
systems can consume it in CI or adapt it to external eval platforms.

Cayu should own the runtime-native view. External tools can own broader
experiment management, hosted dashboards, human review queues, and organization
level workflows.
